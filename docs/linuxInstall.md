# Linux install instructions

Signed packages are on their way, but in the meantime you can use the following.

**NOTE**: _If you experience a problem with dependencies while installing, you may
want to try installing `git` using the package manager for your distro._

## Debian AMD64:
To install brave using apt:
``` 
curl https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brave-apt/keys.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
Now you need to add
```
deb https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brave-apt jesse main  
```
to your /etc/apt/sources.list. Upgrades can be done via:
```
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

Alternatively you can install the deb directly but then you wont get automatic upgrades with apt
```
wget -O brave.deb https://laptop-updates.brave.com/latest/dev/debian64
sudo apt-get install -y gdebi && sudo gdebi brave.deb
