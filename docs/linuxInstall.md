# Linux install instructions

**NOTE**: _If you experience a problem with dependencies while installing, you may
want to try installing `git` using the package manager for your distro._

**NOTE**: _If Brave does not start and shows an error about sandboxing, you may need
to [enable userns in your kernel](https://superuser.com/questions/1094597/enable-user-namespaces-in-debian-kernel#1122977). Running with the `--no-sandbox` flag is NOT recommended!_

## Snapcraft

According to [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/)
> Snaps are quick to install, easy to create, safe to run, and they update automatically and transactionally so your app is always fresh and never broken.

Installation instructions for `snapd` [can be found here](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install). Once `snapd` is installed, installing Brave looks like this:

    snap install brave --beta

## Debian (jessie) and Ubuntu (Zesty, Yakkety, Xenial, and Trusty) AMD64:
To install brave using apt and lsb\_release :

```
curl https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brave-apt/keys.asc | sudo apt-key add 
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brave-apt `lsb_release -sc` main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-`lsb_release -sc`.list
```

You will want to make sure the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-\*.list file lists a new repository and does not contain the word lsb\_release. If you see the word lsb\_release you might not have lsb\_release installed. Otherwise run:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install brave
```

To install the latest which also often has early staging builds:
```
curl https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brave-apt-staging/keys.asc | sudo apt-key add 
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brave-apt-staging `lsb_release -sc` main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-`lsb_release -sc`.list
```

Upgrades can be done via:
```
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

Alternatively you can install the deb directly but then you won't get automatic upgrades:

```
wget -O brave.deb https://laptop-updates.brave.com/latest/dev/debian64
sudo apt-get install -y gdebi && sudo gdebi brave.deb
```
or for Ubuntu
```
wget -O brave.deb https://laptop-updates.brave.com/latest/dev/ubuntu64
sudo dpkg -i brave.deb
```

or for Mint

```
wget -O brave.deb https://laptop-updates.brave.com/latest/mint64
sudo dpkg -i ./brave.deb
```

If there are dependency errors during `dpkg -i`, the following command will
install the dependency for you:
```
sudo apt-get -f install
```
