# Component Structure

The UI is made up of a tree like structure of React components.

<!--
All [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components (with the exception of the top level one named `App`) should extend `ImmutableComponent` which in turn directly extends `React.Component`.
-->
All [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components should extend `React.Component` or `ImmutableComponent` which itself extends `React.Component`.
`ImmutableComponent` is meant to be used with [Immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) props for data.  State should be sent in from props and components should not attempt to modify state themselves.  Instead they should dispatch actions to one of the stores.
`ImmutableComponent` allows component to figure out if any data has changed more efficiently by doing simple top level equality checks only by implementing React's `shouldComponentUpdate`.
