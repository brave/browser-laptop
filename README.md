# Brave Browser

Desktop browser for OS X, Windows and Linux. To download the latest release,
go to https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/releases. To build Brave from
source code, see below.

## Build prerequisites

### All platforms
1. `nodejs` **`>= 5.0`**

    Install from your package manager or download from https://nodejs.org

2. `node-gyp` **`3.2.1`**

        sudo npm install -g node-gyp@3.2.1

### Windows
Ensure you have the following installed:  

* [Node.js 5+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
* [Visual Studio 2013 or 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)  

###  Linux
* `apt-get install libgnome-keyring-dev build-essential`

## Installation

After installing the prerequisites:

1. Clone the git repository from GitHub:

        # For beta testers:
        git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop

        # For devs over HTTPS:
        git clone https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop

        # For devs over SSH:
        git clone git@github.com:brave/browser-laptop.git

2. Open the working directory:

        cd browser-laptop

3. Install the Node (v5+) dependencies:

        npm install

For now, Node 5.8 requires you to `cd node_modules/abp-filter-parser-cpp` after the `npm install` and run `make`.

If this fails on Linux with an error related to `abp-filter-parser-cpp`, try updating to Node 5.9 and `node-gyp` 3.2.1 (see discussion at https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/214)

Additional notes on troubleshooting installation issues are in the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/wiki/Troubleshooting) page in the Wiki.

Some platforms are available as pre-configured VMs. See the [readme](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/blob/master/test/vms/vagrant/README.md) for details.

## Development

The team welcomes contributions to Brave of any kind including documentation, tutorials, bug reports, issues, feature requests, feature implementation, pull requests, helping to manage issues, etc.

[![Throughput Graph](https://graphs.waffle.io/brave/browser-laptop/throughput.svg)](https://waffle.io/brave/browser-laptop/metrics/throughput)

To start the server and file watchers run the following on the command line:

    npm run watch

To run the browser:

    npm start

To run the tests:

    npm run watch-test  or  npm run watch-all

    npm test

Note: Brave uses port 8080 to communicate between its client and server sides by default. If you are using port 8080 for something else (e.g. a web proxy) then you can set the node config to make it use a different one.

You will also have to have two terminal tabs up to run Brave. One for Brave to watch changes, and one to run Brave.

e.g.
npm config set brave:port 9001

### Debugging

See [docs/debugging.md](docs/debugging.md) for information on debugging.

### Running inside of a development version of Brave's Electron fork

We are using a fork of Electron with some minor modifications here: https://github.com/brave/electron

Most of the time you will not need to use that repository, we provide pre-built binaries when you `npm install` with our own fork of [electron-prebuilt](https://github.com/brave/electron-prebuilt).

If you want to add code to Electron itself, then you may want to build it.  An example would be exposing a new event to the webview from Electron.   We try to upstream everything to [atom/electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) but we can take things in our fork early before upstreaming.

## Packaging for bundles, installers, and updates

### OSX:

From within brave-browser you can create a .app file for distribution:

    npm run build-package

After the .app file is built you can create a dmg and update zip with:

    IDENTIFIER=XYZ npm run build-installer

Where XYZ is your signing identifier.

### Windows 7,8,10 x64:

To create a folder with the app .exe and all dependencies:

    npm run build-package

After the above folder is created, you can create a setup (exe, msi, RELEASES file and update nupkg) with:

    CERT_PASSWORD=‘XYZ’ npm run build-installer

  Where XYZ is your authenticode signing password.

### Linux:

To create a package:

    npm run build-package
