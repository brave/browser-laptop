cacheMiss=Confirm Form Resubmission<br> This webpage requires data that you entered earlier in order to be properly displayed. You can send this data again, but by doing so you will repeat any action this page previously performed. Please go back to the previous url and try again.
connectionReset=A connection was reset (corresponding to a TCP RST).
connectionRefused=இணைப்பு முயற்சி மறுக்கப்பட்டது.
connectionAborted=A connection timed out as a result of not receiving an ACK for data sent. This can include a FIN packet that did not get ACK'd.
connectionFailed=இணைப்பு முயற்சி தோல்வியடைந்தது.
nameNotResolved=The host name could not be resolved.
internetDisconnected=இணைய இணைப்பு இழப்பு.
sslProtocolError=An SSL protocol error occurred.
addressInvalid=The IP address or port number is invalid (e.g., cannot connect to the IP address 0 or the port 0).
addressUnreachable=The IP address is unreachable.  This usually means that there is no route to the specified host or network.
sslClientAuthCertNeeded=The server requested a client certificate for SSL client authentication.
tunnelConnectionFailed=A tunnel connection through the proxy could not be established.
noSslVersionsEnabled=No SSL protocol versions are enabled.
sslVersionOrCipherMismatch=The client and server don't support a common SSL protocol version or cipher suite.
sslRenegotiationRequested=The server requested a renegotiation (rehandshake).
proxyAuthUnsupported=The proxy requested authentication (for tunnel establishment) with an unsupported method.
certErrorInSslRenegotiation=During SSL renegotiation (rehandshake), the server sent a certificate with an error. Note: this error is not in the -2xx range so that it won't be handled as a, certificate error.
badSslClientAuthCert=The SSL handshake failed because of a bad or missing client certificate.
connectionTimedOut=இணைப்பு முயற்சி காலாவதியானது.
hostResolverQueueTooLarge=There are too many pending DNS resolves, so a request in the queue was aborted.
socksConnectionFailed=Failed establishing a connection to the SOCKS proxy server for a target host.
socksConnectionHostUnreachable=The SOCKS proxy server failed establishing connection to the target host because that host is unreachable.
npnNegotiationFailed=The request to negotiate an alternate protocol failed.
sslNoRenegotiation=The peer sent an SSL no_renegotiation alert message.
winsockUnexpectedWrittenBytes=Winsock sometimes reports more data written than passed.  This is probably due to a broken LSP.
sslDecompressionFailureAlert=An SSL peer sent us a fatal decompression_failure alert. This typically occurs when a peer selects DEFLATE compression in the mistaken belief that it supports it.
sslBadRecordMacAlert=An SSL peer sent us a fatal bad_record_mac alert. This has been observed from servers with buggy DEFLATE support.
proxyAuthRequested=The proxy requested authentication (for tunnel establishment).
sslWeakServerEphemeralDhKey=The SSL server attempted to use a weak ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key.
proxyConnectionFailed=Could not create a connection to the proxy server. An error occurred either in resolving its name, or in connecting a socket to it. Note that this does NOT include failures during the actual "CONNECT" method of an HTTP proxy.
mandatoryProxyConfigurationFailed=A mandatory proxy configuration could not be used. Currently this means that a mandatory PAC script could not be fetched, parsed or executed.
preconnectMaxSocketLimit=We've hit the max socket limit for the socket pool while preconnecting.  We don't bother trying to preconnect more sockets.
sslClientAuthPrivateKeyAccessDenied=The permission to use the SSL client certificate's private key was denied.

proxyCertificateInvalid=The certificate presented by the HTTPS Proxy was invalid.
nameResolutionFailed=An error occurred when trying to do a name resolution (DNS).
networkAccessDenied=Permission to access the network was denied. This is used to distinguish errors that were most likely caused by a firewall from other access denied errors. See also ERR_ACCESS_DENIED.
temporarilyThrottled=The request throttler module cancelled this request to avoid DDOS.
httpsProxyTunnelResponse=A request to create an SSL tunnel connection through the HTTPS proxy received a non-200 (OK) and non-407 (Proxy Auth) response.  The response body might include a description of why the request failed.
sslClientAuthSignatureFailed=We were unable to sign the CertificateVerify data of an SSL client auth handshake with the client certificate's private key. Possible causes for this include the user implicitly or explicitly denying access to the private key, the private key may not be valid for signing, the key may be relying on a cached handle which is no longer valid, or the CSP won't allow arbitrary data to be signed.
msgTooBig=The message was too large for the transport.  (for example a UDP message which exceeds size threshold).
spdySessionAlreadyExists=A SPDY session already exists, and should be used instead of this connection.
wsProtocolError=Websocket protocol error. Indicates that we are terminating the connection due to a malformed frame or other protocol violation.
addressInUse=Returned when attempting to bind an address that is already in use.
sslHandshakeNotCompleted=An operation failed because the SSL handshake has not completed.
sslBadPeerPublicKey=SSL peer's public key is invalid.
sslPinnedKeyNotInCertChain=The certificate didn't match the built-in public key pins for the host name. The pins are set in net/http/transport_security_state.cc and require that one of a set of public keys exist on the path from the leaf to the root.
clientAuthCertTypeUnsupported=Server request for client certificate did not contain any types we support.
originBoundCertGenerationTypeMismatch=Server requested one type of cert, then requested a different type while the first was still being generated.
sslDecryptErrorAlert=An SSL peer sent us a fatal decrypt_error alert. This typically occurs when a peer could not correctly verify a signature (in CertificateVerify or ServerKeyExchange) or validate a Finished message.
wsThrottleQueueTooLarge=There are too many pending WebSocketJob instances, so the new job was not pushed to the queue.
ssl_server_cert_changed=The SSL server certificate changed in a renegotiation.
sslInappropriateFallback=The SSL server indicated that an unnecessary TLS version fallback was performed.
ctNoSctsVerifiedOk=Certificate Transparency: All Signed Certificate Timestamps failed to verify.
sslUnrecognizedNameAlert=The SSL server sent us a fatal unrecognized_name alert.
socketSetReceiveBufferSizeError=Failed to set the socket's receive buffer size as requested.
socketSetSendBufferSizeError=Failed to set the socket's send buffer size as requested.
socketReceiveBufferSizeUnchangeable=Failed to set the socket's receive buffer size as requested, despite success return code from setsockopt.
socketSendBufferSizeUnchangeable=Failed to set the socket's send buffer size as requested, despite success return code from setsockopt.
sslClientAuthCertBadFormat=Failed to import a client certificate from the platform store into the SSL library.
sslFallbackBeyondMinimumVersion=The SSL server requires falling back to a version older than the configured minimum fallback version, and thus fallback failed.
icannNameCollision=Resolving a hostname to an IP address list included the IPv4 address "127.0.53.53". This is a special IP address which ICANN has recommended to indicate there was a name collision, and alert admins to a potential problem.
sslServerCertBadFormat=The SSL server presented a certificate which could not be decoded. This is not a certificate error code as no X509Certificate object is available. This error is fatal.
ctSthParsingFailed=Certificate Transparency: received a signed tree head that failed to parse.
ctSthIncomplete=Certificate Transparency: Received a signed tree head whose JSON parsing was OK, but was missing some of the fields.
unableToReuseConnectionForProxyAuth=The attempt to reuse a connection to send proxy auth credentials failed before the AuthController was used to generate credentials. The caller should reuse the controller with a new connection. This error is only used internally by the network stack.
invalidURL=The URL is invalid.
disallowedURLScheme=The scheme of the URL is disallowed.
unknownURLScheme=The scheme of the URL is unknown.
tooManyRedirects=Attempting to load an URL resulted in too many redirects.
unsafeRedirect=Attempting to load an URL resulted in an unsafe redirect (e.g., a redirect to file:// is considered unsafe).
unsafePort=Attempting to load an URL with an unsafe port number.  These are port numbers that correspond to services, which are not robust to spurious input that may be constructed as a result of an allowed web construct (e.g., HTTP looks a lot like SMTP, so form submission to port 25 is denied).
invalidResponse=வழங்கியின் பதில் செல்லாதது.
invalidChunkedEncoding=Error in chunked transfer encoding.
methodNotSupported=The server did not support the request method.
unexpectedProxyAuth=The response was 407 (Proxy Authentication Required), yet we did not send the request to a proxy.

malformedIdentity=The identity used for authentication is invalid.
contentDecodingFailed=Content decoding of the response body failed.
networkIoSuspended=An operation could not be completed because all network IO is suspended.

undocumentedSecurityLibraryStatus=An undocumented SSPI or GSSAPI status code was returned.
responseBodyTooBigToDrain=The HTTP response was too big to drain.
responseHeadersMultipleContentLength=The HTTP response contained multiple distinct Content-Length headers.
incompleteSpdyHeaders=SPDY Headers have been received, but not all of them - status or version headers are missing, so we're expecting additional frames to complete them.
pacNotInDhcp=No PAC URL configuration could be retrieved from DHCP. This can indicate either a failure to retrieve the DHCP configuration, or that there was no PAC URL configured in DHCP.
responseHeadersMultipleContentDisposition=The HTTP response contained multiple Content-Disposition headers.
responseHeadersMultipleLocation=The HTTP response contained multiple Location headers.
spdyServerRefusedStream=SPDY server refused the stream. Client should retry. This should never be a user-visible error.

contentLengthMismatch=The HTTP response body transferred fewer bytes than were advertised by the Content-Length header when the connection is closed.
incompleteChunkedEncoding=The HTTP response body is transferred with Chunked-Encoding, but the terminating zero-length chunk was never sent when the connection is closed.
quicProtocolError=There is a QUIC protocol error.
responseHeadersTruncated=The HTTP headers were truncated by an EOF.
