unsafePort=Attempting to load an URL with an unsafe port number.  These are port numbers that correspond to services, which are not robust to spurious input that may be constructed as a result of an allowed web construct (e.g., HTTP looks a lot like SMTP, so form submission to port 25 is denied).
unsafeRedirect=Attempting to load an URL resulted in an unsafe redirect (e.g., a redirect to file:// is considered unsafe).

winsockUnexpectedWrittenBytes=Winsock sometimes reports more data written than passed.  This is probably due to a broken LSP.
wsProtocolError=Websocket protocol error. Indicates that we are terminating the connection due to a malformed frame or other protocol violation.
