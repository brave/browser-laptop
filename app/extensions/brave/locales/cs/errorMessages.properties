connectionReset=Spojení bylo nastaveno znovu (odpovídá TCP RST).
connectionRefused=Pokus o spojení byl odmítnut.
connectionAborted=Spojení vypršelo jako výsledek nepřijetí ACk pro poslaná data. To může zahrnout paket FIN, který nedostal ACK.

nameNotResolved=Název serveru se nepodařilo zpracovat.
internetDisconnected=Internetové spojení bylo ztraceno.
sslProtocolError=Vyskytla se chyba protokolu SSL.
addressInvalid=The IP address or port number is invalid (e.g., cannot connect to the IP address 0 or the port 0).

sslClientAuthCertNeeded=Server požádal o klientský certifikát pro ověření klienta pomocí SSL.
tunnelConnectionFailed=Tunelové spojení přes proxy se nepodařilo zřídit.
noSslVersionsEnabled=Nejsou povoleny žádné verze protokolu SSL.
sslVersionOrCipherMismatch=Klient a server nepodporují běžný protokol SSL nebo šifrovací sadu.
sslRenegotiationRequested=Server požádal o znovuprojednání (opětovné navázání spojení).
proxyAuthUnsupported=The proxy requested authentication (for tunnel establishment) with an unsupported method.
certErrorInSslRenegotiation=During SSL renegotiation (rehandshake), the server sent a certificate with an error. Note: this error is not in the -2xx range so that it won't be handled as a, certificate error.
badSslClientAuthCert=The SSL handshake failed because of a bad or missing client certificate.
connectionTimedOut=Pokus o spojení vypršel.
hostResolverQueueTooLarge=There are too many pending DNS resolves, so a request in the queue was aborted.
socksConnectionFailed=Failed establishing a connection to the SOCKS proxy server for a target host.

npnNegotiationFailed=Žádost o projednání náhradního protokolu selhala.
sslNoRenegotiation=The peer sent an SSL no_renegotiation alert message.
winsockUnexpectedWrittenBytes=Winsock sometimes reports more data written than passed.  This is probably due to a broken LSP.
sslDecompressionFailureAlert=An SSL peer sent us a fatal decompression_failure alert. This typically occurs when a peer selects DEFLATE compression in the mistaken belief that it supports it.
sslBadRecordMacAlert=An SSL peer sent us a fatal bad_record_mac alert. This has been observed from servers with buggy DEFLATE support.
proxyAuthRequested=The proxy requested authentication (for tunnel establishment).
sslWeakServerEphemeralDhKey=The SSL server attempted to use a weak ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key.
proxyConnectionFailed=Could not create a connection to the proxy server. An error occurred either in resolving its name, or in connecting a socket to it. Note that this does NOT include failures during the actual "CONNECT" method of an HTTP proxy.
mandatoryProxyConfigurationFailed=A mandatory proxy configuration could not be used. Currently this means that a mandatory PAC script could not be fetched, parsed or executed.

temporarilyThrottled=The request throttler module cancelled this request to avoid DDOS.
httpsProxyTunnelResponse=A request to create an SSL tunnel connection through the HTTPS proxy received a non-200 (OK) and non-407 (Proxy Auth) response.  The response body might include a description of why the request failed.
sslClientAuthSignatureFailed=We were unable to sign the CertificateVerify data of an SSL client auth handshake with the client certificate's private key. Possible causes for this include the user implicitly or explicitly denying access to the private key, the private key may not be valid for signing, the key may be relying on a cached handle which is no longer valid, or the CSP won't allow arbitrary data to be signed.
msgTooBig=The message was too large for the transport.  (for example a UDP message which exceeds size threshold).
spdySessionAlreadyExists=A SPDY session already exists, and should be used instead of this connection.

clientAuthCertTypeUnsupported=Server request for client certificate did not contain any types we support.
originBoundCertGenerationTypeMismatch=Server requested one type of cert, then requested a different type while the first was still being generated.

socketSetSendBufferSizeError=Failed to set the socket's send buffer size as requested.
socketReceiveBufferSizeUnchangeable=Failed to set the socket's receive buffer size as requested, despite success return code from setsockopt.
socketSendBufferSizeUnchangeable=Failed to set the socket's send buffer size as requested, despite success return code from setsockopt.
sslClientAuthCertBadFormat=Failed to import a client certificate from the platform store into the SSL library.
sslFallbackBeyondMinimumVersion=The SSL server requires falling back to a version older than the configured minimum fallback version, and thus fallback failed.
icannNameCollision=Resolving a hostname to an IP address list included the IPv4 address "127.0.53.53". This is a special IP address which ICANN has recommended to indicate there was a name collision, and alert admins to a potential problem.
sslServerCertBadFormat=The SSL server presented a certificate which could not be decoded. This is not a certificate error code as no X509Certificate object is available. This error is fatal.
ctSthParsingFailed=Certificate Transparency: received a signed tree head that failed to parse.
ctSthIncomplete=Certificate Transparency: Received a signed tree head whose JSON parsing was OK, but was missing some of the fields.

undocumentedSecurityLibraryStatus=An undocumented SSPI or GSSAPI status code was returned.
responseBodyTooBigToDrain=The HTTP response was too big to drain.
responseHeadersMultipleContentLength=The HTTP response contained multiple distinct Content-Length headers.
incompleteSpdyHeaders=SPDY Headers have been received, but not all of them - status or version headers are missing, so we're expecting additional frames to complete them.
pacNotInDhcp=No PAC URL configuration could be retrieved from DHCP. This can indicate either a failure to retrieve the DHCP configuration, or that there was no PAC URL configured in DHCP.
responseHeadersMultipleContentDisposition=The HTTP response contained multiple Content-Disposition headers.
responseHeadersMultipleLocation=The HTTP response contained multiple Location headers.
spdyServerRefusedStream=SPDY server refused the stream. Client should retry. This should never be a user-visible error.
