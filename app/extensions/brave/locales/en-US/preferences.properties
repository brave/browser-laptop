paymentsWelcomeText1=Brave has created a simple way for you to contribute to the sites you use most.
paymentsWelcomeText2=To begin using Brave Payments, simply flip the switch at the top of this window. The rest is easy.
paymentsWelcomeText3=Brave Payments allows publishers to stay in business even though you may have blocked their advertisements with Brave. All of this works while keeping your browsing history private. Your funds are transferred to the site owner through an anonymous ledger system, which makes it impossible for you ever to be identified based on the sites you visit and support.
paymentsWelcomeText4=Brave Payments is currently in Beta. With your help and feedback, we can fine tune the system through the beta period.
paymentsWelcomeText5=Note: Brave Payments uses a country-lookup service in order to provide better user wallet funding options based on your location. This service is completely anonymous.
