privateTabText1=Whether or not you use Tor, private tabs are not logged in page history or counted in Brave Payments calculations. Private tabs and their cookies always vanish when the browser is closed. If you use private tabs without Tor, the sites you visit will be visible to your ISP or your employer. You won’t be anonymous, and sites will learn your public IP address. With Tor, Brave works hard to ensure that you’re extremely difficult to track online while providing a delightful browsing experience. But if your personal safety depends on remaining anonymous you may wish to use the Tor Browser from https://torproject.org/ instead.
