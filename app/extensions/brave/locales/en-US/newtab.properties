privateTabText1=Whether or not you use Tor, private tabs are not logged in page history or counted in Brave Payments calculations. Private tabs and their cookies always vanish when the browser is closed.
privateTabText2=If you use private tabs without Tor, the sites you visit will be visible to your ISP or your employer. You won’t be anonymous, and sites will learn your public IP address.
privateTabText3=With Tor, Brave works hard to ensure that you’re extremely difficult to track online while providing a delightful browsing experience. But if your personal safety depends on remaining anonymous you may wish to use the Tor Browser from https://torproject.org instead.
privateTabTitle=This is a Private Tab
privateTabTorTitle=Make private tabs much more private with Tor
privateTabTorText1=Tor hides your IP address from the sites you visit, and hides the sites you visit from your ISP or your employer. Tor can slow down browsing. Some sites treat anonymous users differently, or might not work at all. Some sites might even ask you to prove you’re human.
privateTabSearchSectionTitle=Private search with DuckDuckGo
privateTabSearchText1=With private search, Brave will use DuckDuckGo to answer your searches while you are in this private tab. DuckDuckGo is a search engine that does not track your search history, enabling you to search privately.
