<hint0 "The Bravery menu allows you turn HTTPS Everywhere on or off. HTTPS Everywhere automatically rewrites your HTTP traffic to HTTPS for supported sites to keep you more secure.">
<hint1 "Brave will always auto-update for you, but you can check for an update on demand in the menu.">
<hint2 "The File menu allows you to create a New Session Tab.  Session tabs are like any other tab but they run in a different user profile.  This allows you to login to the same sites multiple times with the same browser.">
